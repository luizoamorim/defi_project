# Defi DApp

## Project Goals
- Create a defi DApp that will issue tokens to the investors.

## Frontend
- We'll use a create-react-app bootstrap to create our frontend structure.
- Then we can personalize it.

## Blockchain
- This DApp will be created on ethereum environment using tools and libraries like:
- ganache;
- web3js;
- truffle;

## Smart contracts
- We'll start our structure to develop the smart contracts using truffle bootstrap.
- To do it we need to run:
```
truffle init
```
- For that we'll need the truffle installed in your machine.
